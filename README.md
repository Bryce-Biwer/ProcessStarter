# Process Starter

## Overview
Process Starter is a Windows Forms application that allows users to configure and launch processes or commands via customizable buttons. The configuration is handled through a simple text file, making it easy to set up and modify.

## Features
- Dynamic button creation based on a configuration file.
- Support for customizing button text, size, and styles (bold, italic).
- Ability to run executables or console commands.
- Configurable layout options, including spacing and row spacing.

## Configuration File
The configuration file `process_starter.cfg` defines the buttons and their properties. Hereâ€™s how to structure it:

### Config Instructions

You may write anywhere in the config file besides a command line, which then you need to use #To add a comment

Form_Title = name # Defins a window title use 
To define a button use -Begin Button-


#### Buttons have the following properties:
text = My Button # The text displayed on the button
text_size = 8 # The size of text, (8 is the default)
bold = true # Bolds the text
italic = true # Italicize the text

button_size = 130, 25 # Changes the size for the current button and all buttons afterwards must be defined as width, height (130, 25 is the default)

process = notepad.exe # This can be any file your computer can run
command = cd\ & tree # If process is not defined this will run as a console command otherwise it will act as commandline arguments for process
note: You may use \"\{CurrentDirectory}\\path\" as a local path definer

same_line = true # Used to make button appear on the line of the previous button

spacing = 1 # Creates an x amount of blank spaces the width of default button size

row_spacing = 1 # Creates an x amount of blank spaces the height of default button size
note: negative row spacing is allowed, but can have messy results

### Example Config
Set a window title
```
Form_Title = Example Title
```
These will apear vertical which is the default
```
-Begin Button- # comments on rows with commands need a hashtag
text = Button 1
process = notepad.exe # Opens notepad

-Begin Button-
text = Button 2
command = cd\ & tree # Goes to the root of your drive and lists every file (harmless)
```
These will appear side by side
```
-Begin Button-
text = Button 1
row_spacing = 1 # creates a blank line

-Begin Button-
text = Button 2 
same_line = true # will appear next to Button 1
```
The following will create a large button thrice the size of the set button width and twice the size of button height
As well as showing the spacing option 
```
-Begin Button-
row_spacing = 1 # creates a blank line
text = Button 1
italic = true
width = 3
height = 2

-Begin Button-
text = Button 2

-Begin Button-
text = Button 3
spacing = 1 # creates a blank space
same_line = true
```
Following shows blank spot in button layout
```
-Begin Button-
text = Button 1
row_spacing = 1

-Begin Button-
row_spacing = 1
text = Button 2
bold = true
width = 2
height = 2
same_line = true

-Begin Button- # Because Button 2 is twice the size we have this blank spot under Button 2
text = Button 3

-Begin Button-
text = Button 4
same_line = true
```
Following is similar to the last, but it shows how to fill in the blank spot as well as resizing the buttons
```
-Begin Button-
text = Button 1
row_spacing = 1
button_size = 100, 25 # This effects this button and all buttons afterwards

-Begin Button-
row_spacing = 1
text = Button 2
bold = true
italic = true
text_size = 15
width = 2
height = 2
same_line = true

Note: Adding a button here and adding same_line tag would put it above button 4

-Begin Button-
text = Button 3
row_spacing = -1 	# This goes up a line, same line buttons may be covered by Button 2

-Begin Button-
text = Button 4
same_line = true
spacing = 2 # To fix this appearing behind Button 2 we can use spacing
```
